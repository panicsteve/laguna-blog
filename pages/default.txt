Title: Default Post

This is the default post.  It can be found in pages/default.txt

You will need to edit the file bin/config.php with appropriate values for your server before editing or publishing will work.

You add new posts by creating additional text files in the pages directory.  Your text files can use Markdown formatting.

Similarly, you can delete a post by just deleting the file from the pages directory.

After you make changes to the pages directory, re-publish your site by running the publish script located at bin/publish.php

Laguna sorts your posts by modification date, so if you change a post, it will float to the top.

A makeshift post editor is located at bin/edit.php
